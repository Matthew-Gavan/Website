<h2><u><strong>Projects</h2></u></strong>
<p>Here you can find the things that I have been doing in Computer Science during my time at Sixth Form.<p>
<h4><strong><u>Android Studio App</h4></strong></u>
<p>One thing that I have done in Computer Scirnce is making my own app using Android Studio. The app I made was a Rugby Union Score Counter, and when the button for a try is pressed it will increase the score by 5 points, similarly when buttons for penalty kick or drop goal which is 3 points and a conversion for 2 points. Also there is a reset button which resets both scores at the end of the games.<p>
<p>I plan to develop this app even further by adding the yellow and red cards to this app and when these are pressed it will go on to another page which will have the position of the players and then you can choose the positon of the player that received a card and it will be saved and added to a database.<p> 
<h4><strong><u>HTML</h4></strong></u>
<p>This website is also a project from Computing lessons at school. Interested in learning how to try and make your own website? Take a look at the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Visit the HTML tutorials at W3 Schools which is what I looked at to help me create this website.</a></p>
