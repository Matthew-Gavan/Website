<h1><strong><u>About Me</h1></strong></u>
<p>One main hobby of mine is Football, I play football as well as coach football and I'm a manager of my own team at Under 8's which is voluntary. This is all at Crossley Juniors Football CLub in Halifax and I have been involved with this club since the age of 5 when I started training. Then at the age of 10/11 I started to coach for Crossleys, although I couldn't do my Level 1 because I wasn't 16 yet so when I turned 16 I started to do my Level 1 Course the week after. I'm now a Qualified Coach with the Emergency Aid Certificate and the Children Safeguarding Certificate as you have to do these workshops as part of the Course. I do about 14 hours of football per week which includes playing as well as coaching. In addition to coaching for Crossley Juniors, I also recently got a part-time job at a company called Diddikicks Yorkshire which is a coaching company for young footballers from the age of 18 month to 5 years old. This job takes up 4 hours on a Saturday morning and 4 hours on a Sunday morning and I am paid £8 per hour for this. However, when I become a head coach, I will get paid £11 an hour for this.</p> 
<p>Through the years at football, I have won many of awards like the 'Players Player', the 'Managers Player', 'Player of the Year' including the 'Most Improved Player', 'Players Player' and 'Runner-Up to the Player of the Year' for the Open Age team last season which I started playing when I turned 16 for the First Team and The Second Team. However, one of the best ones I have won are probably the 'Long Service' award which I won because I have played for one club all of my life from the age of 5 to the age of 16 in the 'Junior' section and now I play for the Open Age team at the same club.</p>
<p>The other award that I think is one of the best ones is the 'Young Club Person of the Year' award which I have won 3 times, the committee picked me because of the amount of work that I have been doing for the club. For example, at the tournaments that we host every year I go down from 7 o'clock in the morning to put goals up on the pitches and set the pitches up, get all of the stands ready such as the food stand, sweets stand, drinks stand and it's great when people notice and thank you for the amount of work that you do.
